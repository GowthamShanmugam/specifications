= Repository name changes

Repository names need to be updated to follow lowercase, hyphenated convention. The specification intend to cover affected repositories and any code and packaging changes required.


== Problem description

In Fedora, the RPM names usually match the upstream repository names. Currently for tendrl GitHub repositories are not aligned with rpm names. This would make it clearer to everyone that what code comes from where and help to maintain the overall packaging ecosystem consistency.

== Use Cases

None.

== Proposed change

Below repositories to be renamed:
ceph_integration --> ceph-integration
node_agent --> node-agent
gluster_integration --> gluster-integration
common --> commons
tendrl-api --> api
performance_monitoring --> performance-monitoring
tendrl_frontend --> dashboard

=== Alternatives
