= Create and Edit Pool

Write a functionality for creating and editing a Pool in Tendrl-Dashboard UI

== Problem description

For Creating the new Pool we need to Provide forms with different fields
* Pool Name
* Number of Pools to create
* Type()
* Replicas
* Cluster it belongs
* Journal configuration
* OSD's
* PG Count
* Owner
* Quotas

For editing a Pool we can edit:
* Pool Name
* Replicas  
* PG-count
* Quotas

== Use Cases

The user should be able to create a new Pool with the UI and also Edit the values of Pool before confirming the pool creation.

== Proposed change

* Create a Form for Creating a new pool.
* Create a new secondary side nav which will have(https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/2T9LPMEEB#/screens/209774648)
  - Basic setting
  - Advance Configuration
  - Quotas
* Create a list view For the created pools(https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/2T9LPMEEB#/screens/217733678)
* Create review page with data list view.(https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/2T9LPMEEB#/screens/217733679)
* List view should have edit button through which we can edit the following item listed above.

=== Alternatives

The secondary nav is not available in patternfly so we need to create a new one.

Edit Pool:
- User is able to make modifications on pool attributes, e.g. replica count, pg count, and quotas.
- Verify pool type and EC k+m values are not modifiable.
