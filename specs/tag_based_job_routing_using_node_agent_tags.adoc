= Tag based job routing using node agent tags


Add provision in tendrl job management framework to target jobs to specific
nodes using tags.

== Problem description

Currently in tendrl there is no way to target a job to be picked up by
particular set of node(s). This will be necessary when we introduce features
like provisioning, monitoring etc. in tendrl, where we will need some jobs
to be picked up by a certain type of node like monitor nodes in case of ceph
or a provisioning node in case of gluster.

To accommodate things mentioned above we should enhance out job management
framework to provide more control to run jobs on specific set of nodes.

== Use Cases

* Jobs which needs to be targeted on specific type of nodes can make use of
this feature.
example:
monitoring job to get ceph cluster related detail can use this feature
to target such jobs to be executed on monitor node

== Proposed change

We can solve the above problem by introducing tagging to our job management
framework.

Each node will have a list of tags attached to it(can be empty as well). We
will introduce an attribute under node_context called tags to hold the list
of tags. This tags list can be populated during initial node-detection(when
node agent service is started for first time) or subsequently during creation
of cluster or importing of cluster.

Every flow will have a list of tags attributed to it, which indicates the
preference of the node on which that flow has to be executed. We will introduce
an attribute called preferred_tags that holds a list of tags(this can be empty
if there is no preference for the flow) which indicates the type of node on
which the flow has to be executed

The API layer must use the preferred_tags field in flow definition to generate
the job, which will now include an extra field called targeted_tags that will
have same tags as mentioned in the preferred_tags field of flow definition
file for that flow.

To summarize, API will assign tags to jobs after referring the flow definition
file. And the job framework will make sure that a job with certain set of tags
is picked up only by the nodes with those tags.


=== Alternatives

None

=== Data model impact

* Addition of tags attribute under node_context for all nodes

* Addition of preferred_tags attribute under all flows.

* Addition of a field called targeted tags to the job structure.

=== REST API impact

No direct impact to REST end point, but the API layer must make sure the job
format is as per the newly defined format.

=== Security impact

None

=== Notifications/Monitoring impact

Monitoring related flows can make use of this framework change to target jobs
to specific nodes

=== Other end user impact

None

=== Performance Impact

None

=== Other deployer impact

None

=== Developer impact

* Developers must honor and/or utilize the newly added attributes related to
tags in the flow definition, job structure and node context.

=== Work Items

* Change the flow definition file to include the new attribute related to
tagging.

* Change the node context object to include tagging related attribute.

* Modify API layer to include tags as meta-data while generating jobs.

* Modify job routing framework to route jobs based on tags, and make sure
that jobs intended to be run on a particular type of node is run on such
nodes only.

== Dependencies

This specification has some changes that might overlap with the following
spec: https://github.com/Tendrl/specifications/pull/104

== Testing

End to end testing has to be done for verifying this feature. ie An API that
executes a flow(make sure this flow is using this feature) has to be invoked
and seen that the job that is created by API is run on only the intended
node(s).
