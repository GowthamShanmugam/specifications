= Refactor tendrl modules and move the common code to tendrl-common


All the Tendrl modules like tendrl-gluster-integartion, tendrl-node-agent etc
use various persisters, managers and job executors which have almost similar
logic written and could ideally be moved to the common module tendrl-common.

Any module specific logic can be implemented as part of extended classes from
these common ones defined in tendrl-common module.


== Problem description

Currently there are lot of duplicate classes, code written across Tendrl modules
like persister for central store, manager, job handlers from the etcd queue.
Also base classes for flows, atoms and test cases are replicated across modules.

These replicated classes and sources could be moved to the common module and
individual modules can either use them as is or extend them for additional
business logic.

Even there are various sample configuration files which are replicated across
the tendrl modules and could be more organized and moved to common module. Only
modules specific configurations should be kept as part of the individual modules


== Use Cases

* Moving of all the common code from various tendrl modules would make sure that
individual modules dont have specific implementations for similar stuff. Also
the common modules plays as a library which could be referred and utilized by
any module easily.

== Proposed change

* Move the base flow class to common module and all individual flows in the
other modules can extend from this

* Move all the utilities to common module, which are nowhere specific to a
bridge in tendrl (e.g. flow utils, manager utils etc)

* Define base class for Manager in common module and extend from this in
individual modules

* Define base class for Persister in common module and extend from this in
individual modules

* Define base job handler (rpc) in common module and if required extend from the
same in individual modules

* Move the base test class to common module and extend all the test cases from
the same in individual modules

* Re-factor the code to change the logging directory as per standardization

* Re-factor the code across various modules to fix test cases and attain the
code coverage level to 90%

* Move the command executor, package installer and service manager utilities
from node_agent module to common module as its generic in nature and can be
used by other modules as well.

None

=== Data model impact

None

=== Impacted modules

==== Tendrl API impact

None

==== Tendrl/common impact

* Common module gets all common classes and code moved here e.g.
** Common Manager class
** Common Persister class
** Common Job Queue Handler class
** Utilities
** Base flow class
** Base atom class
** Base test case class
** Configuration management logic
** Command executor, package installer and service manager utilities

==== Tendrl/node_agent impact

* Extend common Manager

* Extend common Persister

* Extend common job queue handler

* Extend all the flows from common flow class

* Extend all the atoms from common atom class

* Extend all the test cases from common test class

* Remove command executor, package installer and service manager as its
now moved to common module

==== SDS integration impact

* Extend common Manager

* Extend common Persister

* Extend common job queue handler

* Extend all the flows from common flow class

* Extend all the atoms from common atom class

* Extend all the test cases from common test class

==== Notifications/Monitoring impact

* Extend common Manager

* Extend common Persister

* Extend common job queue handler

* Extend all the flows from common flow class

* Extend all the atoms from common atom class

* Extend all the test cases from common test class

==== Security impact

None

==== Performance impact

None

==== Other deployer impact

None

==== Developer impact

None

== Implementation

As part of above mentioned movement of classes and code to common module as a
libary would affect the below flows majorly

* Loading the cluster data to central store from managers. Only the SDS
integration specific logic for reading and processing the cluster data remains
within the integration modules and rest common logic is inherited from common
module.

* The way the job are picked and processed from job queue of etcd. From specific
integration modules only the common library code would be invoked to get the job
done.

* The integration specific modules would extend the base persister from common
module and would additionally provide SDS specific functionality written. These
functions would mostly invoke the common module library function for doing the
actual jobs for persistence to the central store.

* The flows and atoms classes defined in individual SDS integration modules
would extend from common library defined classes. So effectively these flows and
atoms satisfy `is-a` relation with common module definitions of flow and atom.

* The source code flow which takes care of loading and availing the
configurations would change. The common module would provide all the library
functions which can load and avail the configurations in understandable format
to different modules as long as they provide the location details of these
configuration files. The common module as library doesn't default to any
location for these configuration files.

* The node agent flows which invoke command executor, package installer and
service manager now need to refer common module utilities as the code is moved
to common module now.

== Work items

* Introduce a base class Manager under common module

* Introduce a base class Persister under common module

* Introduce a base class Rpc under common module

* Move the base Flow class to common module

* Introduce a base Atom class under common module

* Move utilities (e.g. flow utils and manager util) to common module

* Move the base test class to common module

* Move the common configurations to common module

* Extend the Manager, Persister and Rpc in individual modules from common

* Extend the Flow and Atom in individual flows and atoms of the individual
modules

* Re-factor the code in different modules to use common utilities from common
module

* Re-factor the code for standardizing the logging directories for modules

* Extend the base test class in individual test cases in modules

* Re-factor the test cases and make sure code coverage is 90% or more

* Move the command executor, package installer and service manager utilities
to common module


== Dependencies

None

== Testing

* Sanity check for a job execution

* Verify if logs are created as per the standard paths

* Verify if test case code coverage is 90% or more for all the modules


== Documentation impact

* Update the tendrl/common document and remove the logging yaml related
changes as the common module is now used as a library and doesnt have
its own logging. Rather it would use specific module's logging e.g.
node-agent, gluster-integration etc.
