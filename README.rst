Tendrl Specifications
==================================

This git repository is used to hold approved design specifications for additions
to the Tendrl project.  Reviews of the specs are done via Pull requests on this repo, using a
similar workflow to how we review and merge changes to the code itself.

The layout of this repository is::

  specs/<spec_name>.rst

You can find an example spec in `specs/template.rst`.
